# selenium-aws
Python stuff to create on-demand AWS nodes for selenium grid

This will actually include Vagrant configurations that can be used to create nodes and hubs and python code to use to set up an AWS test environment from nothing.  It will include:

AMIs for both hubs and nodes
Security Group settings
VPC stuff (maybe?)

It currently requires:
Vagrant
Nothing else, as this is really just initial commit stuff.
