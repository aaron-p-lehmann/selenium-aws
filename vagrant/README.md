This is where the Vagrantfile and configurations will that will build Selenium Hubs and Nodes on AWS.  They will be used at initial setup, and as a place to put configuration because I don't want the AMIs on AWS to be the source of truth.

This requires:
vagrant
vagrant-aws plugin

I'm currently shamelessly cribbing from blog.scottlowe.org/2016/09/15/using-vagrant-with-aws/
